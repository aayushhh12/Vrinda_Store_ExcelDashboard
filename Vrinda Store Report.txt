VRINDA STORE ANNUAL REPORT

Data has been collected from YOUTUBE

Lets start with data Cleaning. I checked the data there was need to clean the GENDER section and QUANTITY section. I cleaned the data using FIND & REPLACE function of Excel.

Now, Let's do DATA PROCESSING. Insert one column after age as AGE GROUP and apply the formula "=IF([@Age]>=50,"Senior", IF([@Age]>=30,"Adult","Teenager"))" this will group the ages then to make it process fast we will paste it as values. We will add another column near Date as month and give the formula "=TEXT([@Date],"mmm")" and then the month will be printed. Now to make it process fast we will paste it as values.

Data Analysis
Now, for the analysis we will start with pivot table. Click the pivot table option and make a table containing months, Sum of Amount, and count of Order Id. Then we will create a combo graph and select secondary axis also. Then we will format the axis. Like this we will create multiple different types of graph for dashboard. 
Then we will add the slicers to make it dynamic and connect the slicers with all the charts. Then we will add few hyperlinks on the icons to directly go to the data sheets. 

Hence, our Dashboard is ready for Vrinda Store. The data has been collected from Risabh Mishra's Youtube Channel. Thankyou to Rishabh Mishra for the guidance.
